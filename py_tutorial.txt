Yield: is a generator
	- is a function that remembers the point in the function body where it last returned, plus
	> local variable || generators do not store values permanently hence saving memory when working with a large dataset

	==> Yield is going to keep track of its place, when called a second time, it remembers its state and returns the next value

	[[ Look at it as lying between a print and a return statement
		 while a return statement will terminate the function a print statement will print its values which renders them useless 
		 for further computation ]]

SIMULATION
===============================

Analytical Models
-----------------
	-Predict behaviour given some initial conditions and some parameters

Simulation Methods
	- Estimate what my happen given conditions and doing that multiple times 
	- Some systems are not mathematically tractable
	- Successfully refining series of simulation
	- Easy to extract intermediate result that building
	- approximation to reality
	- descriptive not prescriptive
